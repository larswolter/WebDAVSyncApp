# WebDAVSyncAPP
An application to sync files from a webdav server (Nextcloud for example). 
First usage is to sync some audiobooks 

## Syncing files with Webdav

The app shows local files and compares them with files on a webdav server. It then allows to download non existing files from webdav to the target folder.
Use the settings page to specify the webdav URL, target folder and credentials. You can also select if files that do not exist on the webdav should be removed locally.

## Planed features

* Adding multiple sync jobs, defining file type and locations
* Better comparison between local and remote, not just filename but hash/filesize/modified date
* Show more progress during download
* Automatic sync in the background
* Make a good looking UI
* Sharing files
